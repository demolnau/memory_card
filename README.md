# Memory Card Game

Create a memory card game using React for the Odin Project. The objective is to get some experience using "useEffect()" Note that the images 
for the cards take time to load.

TODO: 
 - make the cards less hideous
 - make a loading screen 
 - sub out any commands possible to use useEffect more
